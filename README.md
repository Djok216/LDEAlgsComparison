# Slopes vs Graph benchmark

The code works only on linux. <br>
To run the benchmark you should open the scripts folder and run the following command:
```
python3 doComparison.py 1 100000 0 0 100 100
```
Because it takes several hours to run the whole benchmark, you can test the script using the following command:
```
python3 doComparison.py 1 10 0 0 4 4
```
